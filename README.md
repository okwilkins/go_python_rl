## Getting Started

This project uses a dev container, which is the easiest way to set up a consistent development environment. Dev containers provide all the necessary tools, dependencies, and configuration, so you can focus on coding right away.

### Using Dev Containers

This project uses a dev container for a consistent development environment. To get started:

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. On Windows/Linux, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and run the command `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`. On Mac, press `Cmd+Shift+P` and run the same command.
3. VS Code will build and start the dev container, providing access to the project's codebase and dependencies.


### Local Development

If you prefer not to use the dev container, you can also set up a local development environment. Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.21 or newer)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.9 or newer)


Sure, here's the updated README with a section for Docker and Docker Compose:
